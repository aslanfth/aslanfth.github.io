## About
I am a PhD candidate in [Networked Systems Group](https://www.tudelft.nl/en/eemcs/the-faculty/departments/software-technology/networked-systems), EEMCS, TU Delft. My research area consists of optimization of mobile networks. I work mainly on fairness of beyond 5G networks under the supervision of [Prof. George Iosifidis](https://www.futurenetworkslab.net/). My PhD is funded by [DAEMON](https://cordis.europa.eu/project/id/101017109) and [ORIGAMI](https://sns-origami.eu/).

## Previous Work
I completed my masters at Bilkent University, Ankara. My masters [thesis](https://aslanfth.github.io/publication/2021-09-15-msthesis) is focused on classifying irregular time-series data using Neural Networks.

During my masters, I was employed by Turk Telekom as part of [5G and Beyond Joint Graduate Support Programme](https://5gtrforum.org.tr/en).
